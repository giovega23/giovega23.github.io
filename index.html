    <h1>BoxBudy Mobile Application Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how BoxBudy (the "App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect information necessary to provide and improve the services of the BoxBudy application.</p>

    <h3>A. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p>We do not require you to register an account or provide personal identifying information like your name or email address.</p>

    <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>When you use the App, we automatically collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data (Approximate/Precise):</strong> We collect your device's location when you grant the App permission to use location services. This is essential for displaying relevant nearby stores and providing map functionality. You can withdraw this consent at any time through your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and Usage Data (Telemetry):</strong> We collect anonymous information about how you access and use the App, including your device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and information about your interactions with the map (e.g., map view events, feature usage, and performance metrics).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To display store locations, filter search results by location, and enable direction/navigation features.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To understand which features are most used, diagnose technical problems, and improve app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To enforce our terms and comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclosure and Sharing of Your Information (Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>We share information with third parties only to the extent necessary to provide the services and as permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>Mapping and Geocoding Services (Mapbox):</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Mapbox</strong> for all mapping, spatial data, and visualization services. By using our map feature, information including your device's IP address, usage data, and map view events is collected and sent to Mapbox for billing, service operation, and product improvement.</p>
    <p>This data is subject to the <strong>Mapbox Privacy Policy</strong>, which can be reviewed at: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy">https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Legal Compliance and Protection:</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the safety of users of the service or the public.</p>

    <h2>4. Public Data Disclaimer</h2>
    <div class="disclaimer-box">
        <h3>General Data Disclaimer:</h3>
        <p>BoxBudy relies on publicly available business registration data from official government sources (City and County of San Francisco, Marin County). The businesses listed in this application are included solely based on public registration records and are <strong>not endorsed by, partnered with, or affiliated</strong> with BoxBudy. We do not guarantee the accuracy, current status, or completeness of this information. Business operations, locations, and services are subject to change, and we recommend independent verification. BoxBudy is not responsible for any actions taken based on the data provided.</p>

    <p>You have control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Services:</strong> You can prevent the App from accessing your device's location at any time by changing the settings on your device. However, disabling location services will limit the App's core functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking and Telemetry:</strong> While Mapbox telemetry is anonymous, you may have control over diagnostic data collection within your device's operating system settings.</li>
    </ul>
